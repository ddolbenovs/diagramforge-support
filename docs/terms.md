# Terms of Service â€” DiagramForge

**Last updated:** 2025-10-31

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your installation and use of the DiagramForge Confluence app ("App"). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Scope
DiagramForge provides functionality to render text-based diagrams within Confluence by forwarding diagram source to a Kroki-compatible rendering endpoint and embedding the resulting SVG. The App does not host or manage Kroki itself; administrators configure the endpoint.

## 2. Usage and license
- The App is provided under the license displayed in the Atlassian Marketplace listing or supplied with the App package.
- The developer grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the App in accordance with these Terms and the license applied to the App.

## 3. User content
- You are solely responsible for the content you submit to the App (diagram source). The App forwards that content to the configured Kroki endpoint for rendering. Do not submit content that you do not have permission to use or that contains sensitive personal data unless you control the rendering endpoint and its data handling.
- The developer is not responsible for any user content you or other users submit via Confluence.

## 4. Privacy and third-party services
- Rendering may involve third-party services (e.g., public `kroki.io`) or self-hosted instances. Use of third-party services is at your discretion and is subject to those services' terms and privacy policies.
- If you choose to use a public Kroki endpoint, you acknowledge that diagram source will be transmitted to that service.

## 5. Support and liability
- Support is provided as indicated in the Marketplace listing or via the repository Issues page.
- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE APP.

## 6. Limitation of liability
- The developer's aggregate liability for claims related to the App shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the App (if any) or a nominal amount permitted by applicable law.

## 7. Governing law
- These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer's jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

## 8. Changes
- The developer may revise these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after revised Terms are published constitutes acceptance of those changes.
